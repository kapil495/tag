this is a online multiplayer game which is of 30 players .
there would be 3 randomly choosen persons that will be chasers and cath all the rest 27 player.
these 3 persons are given color as red , blue , yellow (expected to be different ash ketchum from pokemon cap but sprite not found)
whenever a runner got cought , he/she becomes the part of team red / yellow / blue and now he/she has to cath rest of the runners but heres a twist . they have to defeat themm by attacking then team leader will come and throw pokeball to cath.
as the runners decreses , the speed of runners increases
